/**
 * This method saves data in TrueVault and the internal server. It also creates a new group to
 * ensure the Reviewer Doctor and Approver Doctor can access the data appropriately, but other
 * Doctors cannot. It does a few non-obvious things:
 *
 *   - Upload images and structured PHI to TrueVault. Create a second empty TrueVault document
 *     to hold the reviewer's notes, to allow different permissions for the case data (read only for
 *     reviewer) and the report notes (read/write by reviewer).
 *   - Create groups that enforce desired access to the TrueVault images, case data, and review
 *     data.
 *   - Save metadata to the internal server (not TrueVault) to allow custom aggregate analytics
 *     and workflow rules.
 *
 * `internalCaseCreator` is a function used to create a new case on the internal database. In the
 * setup script's case, this interacts with the database directly to create scenarios that are not
 * possible to express using the public API. In the UI's case, it will call the API via HTTP.
